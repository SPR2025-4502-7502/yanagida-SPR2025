<h1>Cayli's top 10 favorite mountains ranked</h1>

<p>Here’s a list of my top 10 favorite mountains across the world.</p>

<div>
	<ol>
		<li><h2>Rainier</h2></li> 

		<h3>Washington State, United States
46.8523° N, 121.7603° W</h3>


		<p>Growing up in Washington State, I grew up seeing this mountain almost every day. Mount Rainier is the largest mountain in the contiguous United States, and ranks first due to its iconic structure and personal meaning.</p>

			<li><h2>Cerro Torre</h2></li> 

			<h3>El Chaten, Patagonia, Argentina/Chile
49.2931° S, 73.0979° W</h3>


			<p>Although I’ve never been to Patagonia, it has always been a lifelong dream. This mountain captured my attention because of its unusual shape and isolated location.</p> 

			<li><h2>Vestrahorn</h2></li> 

			<h3>Höfn, Iceland
64.2733° N, 15.0086° W</h3>


			<p>I’ve been to Iceland twice, but I’ve never seen this mountain. On the eastern part of the island, it is on the opposite side from Reykjavik, the capital city.</p>

			<li><h2>Ko'olau Range</h2></li> 

			<h3>Kaneohe, O’ahu, Hawai’i, United States
21°27′0″N 157°54′0″W﻿ / ﻿21.45000°N 157.90000°W</h3>

			<p>My parents are from Hawai’i, so I grew up traveling through the mountains in order to get to my dad’s hometown of Kaneohe.</p>

			<li><h2>Seceda</h2></li> 

		<h3>The Dolomites, Italy
46.5981° N, 11.7242° E</h3>


			<p>The Dolomites boast some incredible peaks, but this one is on my bucket list.</p>

			<li><h2>Stanage Edge</h2></li> 

			<h3>Peak District National Park, Derbyshire, England, United Kingdom
53.3473° N, 1.6333° W</h3>


			<p>As what is quite possibly my favorite place on Earth, Stanage Edge ranks sixth because it’s technically not a mountain — but who cares?</p>

			<li><h2>Machu Picchu</h2></li> 

			<h3>Aguas Calientes, Peru 
13.1632° S, 72.5453° W</h3>


			<p>I visited Machu Picchu when I was 15 years old. The memory will stick with me forever.</p>

			<li><h2>Mylingur</h2></li> 

				<h3>Streymoy Island, Faroe Islands
62.3017° N, 7.2128° W</h3>


				<p>Another cliff that’s technically not a mountain, but is just too good to leave out.</p>

			<li><h2>Oberlin</h2></li> 

			<h3>Glacier National Park, Montana, United States
48° 42' 16'' N, 113° 44' 12'' W</h3>


			<p>Montana has to be one of the most beautiful places on the planet. Bucket list material!!!</p>

			<li><h2>Wellhorn</h2></li> 

				<h3>Bernese Oberland, Switzerland 
46.6557° N, 8.1420° E</h3>

				<p>Ranking last, Wellhorn’s stunning and unique structure makes it a top 10 favorite.</p>
