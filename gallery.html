        <h1>Hiking Stanage Edge!</h1>
          <p>Follow along for a guide of my hike through Stanage Edge in England’s Peak District National Park!</p>
             <p>During the summer before my senior year in undergrad, I studied abroad in London. This was a great opportunity to gain more real world journalism experience, but it was also a great opportunity for me to visit Stanage Edge, which is a location featured in my favorite movie, Pride and Prejudice (2005). I bought a train ticket to Doncaster in northern England and then caught another train to Sheffield. From there, I bought a ticket to Manchester and got off on the first stop between the two cities in a town called Hathersage. 

     Hathersage is well known for being a location where Robin Hood spent some of his time — legend has it that he had a hideout in a cave somewhere on Stanage Edge. Although I didn’t travel to Hathersage to visit the town, it was absolutely adorable. Follow my trek from the train station all the way to the cliffs!

        After I got off the train, I walked through a residential area. One of the first things I could see on the horizon were these beautiful rolling hills. Having been in the city all summer, it was great to be out in nature. <time datetime="2023">2023</time>

        Hathersage is classified as a village, which adds to its charm. I really enjoyed the cobblestone and the brick!  <time datetime="2022">2023</time>

       After walking through the town, I got to a field where multiple signs pointed in the direction of a specific church. It was so quiet, and the cows were peacefully eating the grass in the field. At this point, I could already see the cliffs of Stanage Edge, which was very helpful with navigation and knowing where I was going.  <time datetime="2022">2023</time>

        Once I got to the end of the field, I walked through a gate and then made my way through another grassy field with a stream. I kept walking until I entered into a paved pathway that was under a canopy of trees. It was pretty dark at spots, but the temperature was nice because of it. As I gained elevation, I could start to look around and see the hills around me.

        This was around the time where I kind of got lost. However, since I could see the cliffs and knew which direction I was going the whole time, it made it a bit easier. I accidentally walked through someone’s farm and had to run away from a few pigs, but besides that, it was a very pleasant walk.

      <figcaption>
        I walked through the grassy fields and got to a very heavily wooded pathway. I walked through thick brush in order to get to the top of the hill. Throughout the whole time, I was worried I was going to get ticks because of all of the leaves and bushes that were touching me, but when I saw the view at the end, it would have been worth it! 
When I got to the top, there was a road that connected to the path. I followed the road, and it took me past beautiful purple flowers. I could see that I was almost to Stanage Edge. This was when I started to get really excited!

        The road I was walking down connected to a main road with a decent amount of traffic. I walked on the side where there were sheep that came up to me. I tried my best to pet the sheep while also not getting hit by any cars. 

I walked into the Stanage Edge parking lot. A few people had climbing equipment. I didn’t realize this at the time, but Stanage Edge draws a lot of climbers. 

The last little bit of the trail was the steepest part. I walked up it to finally make it to the cliffs, and then climbed on a few rocks in order to get up to the ridge. I was so happy to finally be there and be able to do the hike.

        All in all, this hike was one of my favorites, and it was definitely worth the $80 I paid in train tickets. It took about an hour in total from the train station to the peak. It was just as beautiful as I thought it would be, and the weather could not have been better! I highly recommend this hike to anyone who enjoys nature.    <time datetime="2022">2023</time>
